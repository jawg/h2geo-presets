## $.groups.$.items.$.constraints
This field allows to declare a set of constraints applied on an item.
A constraint is aware of the item tags.

A constraint has the following structure:
```
- type: # Type of constraint. Ex: TAG
  source: # This field is mandatoryrege
  condition: # This field is mandatory
  action: # This field is mandatory
```

## $.groups.$.items.$.constraints.$.source
This field defines the source where constraint should be operating, depending on constraint type.
Today, the only available constraint type is **TAG**

### TYPE
```
constraints:
 - source:
    - type: TAG
      key: mytagsource
```

For type **TAG**:
Constraint source is the source tag.

## $.groups.$.items.$.constraints.$.condition
This field defines the conditional operation to perform on the constraint source.
Two  conditions are specified in this version: **EXISTS**, **EQUALS**

### EXISTS
```
condition:
 - type: EXISTS
   value: true
```
### EQUALS
```
condition:
 - type: EQUALS
   value: thevalueofmysource
```

## $.groups.$.items.$.constraints.$.action
This field defines the action to perform once condition has been met.
One implementation has been specified in this version: **SET_TAG_VALUE**

### SET_TAG_VALUE
```
action:
 - type: SET_TAG_VALUE
   key: mytargettag
   value: mytargettagvalue
```

### Examples
This constraint will change 'myothertag' when 'myoptionaltag' is present
```
 constraints:
  - source:
      - type: TAG
        key: myoptionaltag
    condition:
      - type: EXISTS
        value: true
    action:
      - TYPE: SET_TAG_VALUE
        key: myothertag
        value: mytargettagvalue
```

This constraint will change 'myothertag' when 'mytag' value equals to 'helloworld'
```
 constraints:
  - source:
     -type: TAG
      key: myoptionaltag
    condition:
     - type: EQUALS
       value: helloworld
    action:
    - TYPE: SET_TAG_VALUE
      key: myothertag
      value: mytargettagvalue
```
